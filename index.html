	<h1> Introducing Delwin Portillo </h1>
	<img src= me.jpg width="400px" height="500px">

	<p> Hello everyone! My name is Delwin Portillo and I am super excited to begin my journalist journey here in NYC! I have no background in journalism, but have a strong passion for it. Prior to this, I was a salesman where I discovered my love for storytelling and data. Below is a list of my journalist interests.</p>
	<ul> 
		<li> Data </li>
		<li> Politics </li>
		<li> Arts & Culture </li>
		<li> Video </li>
	</ul>

	<p> Below is a list of 3 of my favorite journalism stories and a brief description about why! </p>
	<ul>
		<li> <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/~col8/lobsterarticle.pdf" target="blank"> Consider the Lobster </a>  I love how David Foster Wallace uses humor and self-deprecation to gain trust with the audience. Reminds me of a written version of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. </li>
		<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6MwGeOm8iI" target="blank"> MultiLevel Marketing </a>  Speaking of John Oliver, this is one of my top episodes of his and a great piece of journalism. Him and his team do a great job at breaking down big overarching stories and simplifying them for everyone. He took this story a step further and even had it translated to spanish since MLM's have a big impact on the hispanic community. </li>
		<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsD0e1k4d90" target ="blank"> The Worst Update in Youtube History </a> Following my trend of video journalism, in this video Taylor Lorenz does a great job at the breaking down the dangers of data surveillance in the guise of safety. She does a great job pointing out how we got to the point that Youtube is asking millions for age verification, and the risks that come with that.  </li>
